# Guess the Country

A simple game where you have to guess the country given a partial map of it. The country is randomly selected from a list of all countries in the world.

You can play the game by running the application and using the mouse to rotate the globe and zoom in and out. To make a guess, simply type the name of the country in the input field at the top of the screen and press enter. The application will then tell you if your guess was correct or not.

The game is written in TypeScript and uses the Three.js library to render the globe. The country data is from the Natural Earth dataset.

The application can be accessed at [https://globe.fsadannn.com](https://globe.fsadannn.com).
